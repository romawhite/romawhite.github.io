Mangrove forests are important coastal wetlands for the blue carbon budget and play a significant role in mitigating global climate change. However, spatial patterns of carbon stocks in mangrove forests on an island scale have not been quantified owing to methodological limitations and lack of understanding of controlling factors. We took the entire Hainan Island as a case study and aimed to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the spatial patterns and driving factors of carbon stocks in mangrove forests.
