This is private space for introducing myself and recording some key notes. Dr. Luoma WAN, who is currently a honorary lecturer from the Department of Geography, the Hong Kong University. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Space and Earth Information Science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) with a specific focus on wetland and species mapping of mangrove using deep learning/machine learning with high-resolution multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data. After graduation, he worked as postdoctral fellow in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-informatics, the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity (PolyU). Dr. Wan has published more than 10 papers on mangrove mapping and one most cited paper in Annals of GIS. He also has rich experience in field surveys on mangroves, including several collaborated field surveys in Guangdong, Hainan (National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey), and Hong Kong. With Dr. Wan’s expertise area in mangroves and remote sensing, he will serve as a mangrove remote sensing specialist in the project focus on habitat change mapping using more advanced and robust techniques.
